<p align="center">Hi, I'm Marcos Alarcon a cybersecurity student and self taught developer.
I'm currently in my 4th semester of the Technology Against Cybercrime program at Cape Fear Community College, working toward my Associate degree. I’m originally from Cuba, 19 years old, and also studying ESL alongside my technical coursework.</p>

<p align="center">I’ve been learning and building in the field of computing for the past 5 years, entirely self taught. Technology is not just something I study it’s my daily routine, my work, my hobby, and my lifestyle. I enjoy building tools, understanding how systems behave and exploring cybersecurity from both defensive and analytical perspectives.</p>
